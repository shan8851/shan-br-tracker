# Bankroll Tracker

## Tech

A simple bankroll tracker for live games. Created with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). The stack is comprised of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- Styled with [daisyUi](https://daisyui.com/) ❤️ 

## Idea

The idea is simple. There are many trackers out there in the shape of apps, which are convenient, but are often maintained for a short period of time and then leave the user high and dry. I built this for myself, but intend to open it up to my fellow poker players in due course. I might maje this a fully fledged application at some point with `React Native`, but for now a fully responsive web application will suffice.

## Features

Right now the tracker is fairly barebones and has a simple home page interface showing key stats broken down by tournaments and cash sessions. As well as the ability to deposit and withraw from the bankroll. However I have many plans to iterate and build on this in the future.

## What to expect

- Theme picker. I know not everyone is a fan of the daisyUI cyberpunk theme, so I will add a theme picker
- More auth options. Right now the auth is via GitHub, which is fine while i use it personally, but I will enable more options from next auth when I plan to share this with other players
- Dedicated pages for both cash and MTTs where you can see individual session results and more in depth stats
- CSV export
